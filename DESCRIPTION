Description: Generate continuous (normal or non-normal), binary, ordinal, and count (Poisson or Negative 
    Binomial) variables with a specified correlation matrix.  It can also produce a single continuous 
    variable.  This package can be used to simulate data sets that mimic real-world situations (i.e. 
    clinical data sets, plasmodes).  All variables are generated from standard normal variables with 
    an imposed intermediate correlation matrix.  Continuous variables are simulated by 
    specifying mean, variance, skewness, standardized kurtosis, and fifth and sixth standardized 
    cumulants using either Fleishman's Third-Order or Headrick's Fifth-Order Polynomial 
    Transformation.  Binary and ordinal variables are simulated using a modification of GenOrd's 
    ordsample function.  Count variables are simulated using the inverse cdf method.  There are 
    two simulation pathways which differ primarily according to the calculation of the 
    intermediate correlation matrix.  In Method 1, the intercorrelations involving count variables 
    are determined using a simulation based, logarithmic correlation correction (adapting Yahav 
    and Shmueli's 2012 method).  In Method 2, the count variables are treated as ordinal 
    (adapting Barbiero and Ferrari's 2015 modification of GenOrd).  There is an optional error 
    loop that corrects the final correlation matrix to be within a user-specified precision 
    value of the target matrix. The package also includes functions to calculate standardized 
    cumulants for theoretical distributions or from real data sets, check if a target 
    correlation matrix is within the possible correlation bounds (given the distributions of 
    the simulated variables), summarize results (numerically or graphically), to verify valid 
    power method pdfs, and to calculate lower standardized kurtosis bounds.
